Not gonna lie, this one was a doozy.<br/>

This is a simple calculator application that can be used to perform arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as well as calculating percentages.<br/>

This app was made with HTML, CSS, and lots of JavaScript. I think the most difficult part was getting the logic down for displaying values and storing them, but thankfully I managed to find something that worked.<br/>

Unfortunately, no keyboard support yet, but I'd love to revisit this project one day and try my hand at adding it (and maybe fix up the messy code too).<br/>
